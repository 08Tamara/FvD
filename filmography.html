            <p>As the Empire of the Sun crumbles upon itself and a rain of firebombs falls upon Japan, the final death
                march of a nation is echoed in millions of smaller tragedies. This is the story of Seita and his younger
                sister Setsuko, two children born at the wrong time, in the wrong place, and now cast adrift in a world
                that lacks not the care to shelter them, but simply the resources. Forced to fend for themselves in the
                aftermath of fires that swept entire cities from the face of the earth, their doomed struggle is both a
                tribute to the human spirit and the stuff of nightmares. Beautiful, yet at times brutal and horrifying.
                Based on the retellings of survivor Nosaka Akiyuki and directed by Iaso Takahata (co-founder, with Hayao
                Miyazaki, of Japan's legendary Studio Ghibli,) Grave of the Fireflies has been universally hailed as an
                artistic and emotional tour de force. Now digitally remastered and restored, it is one of the rare films
                that truly deserves to be called a masterpiece.</p>
